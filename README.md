# Overview 
The metric showcases the following 4 topics:
 - The average surface temperature deviation from the 1951-1980 baseline across the 1990-2021 period for 12 countries
 - The analysis of CO2 emission amounts from 1995-2020 based on countries of the world and different working sectors
 - The Impact of Global Warming and rise of extreme weather events between 1990-2021 for the top 12 countries where mean temperature have increased significantly
 - The analysis of government spending on environmental protection

# Files Included:
Temperature Change.ipynb, Climate_Change_CO2.ipynb, WeatherPatterns.ipynb, EnvironmentProtectionExpendetures.ipynb : This Jupyter Notebook contains the Python code and analysis for the Global Warming project. It includes data loading, manipulation, calculations, and visualizations. Resources/Data.csv: CSV file containing temperature change-related data, including 12 countries such as Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.


# How to Use:
Clone this repository to your local machine. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. Open the .ipynb files using Jupyter Notebook. Follow the instructions and run the code cells to execute the analysis. Review the output, including summary tables, visualizations, and insights derived from the analysis.

Data Sets
Data sets were obtained from the following websites:
Source: The Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) , Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) / Université catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain), Brussels, Belgium 
EM-DAT: The Emergency Events Database - Université catholique de Louvain (UCL) - CRED, D. Guha-Sapir - www.emdat.be, Brussels, Belgium.
Only climate related disasters (Wildfire, Storm, Landslide, Flood, Extreme Temperature, Drought, Fog, Wave Action and Glacial Lake Outburst) are covered. See the CID Glossary for the definitions.
EM-DAT covers disasters that:
i.          Killed ten (10) or more people 
ii.         Affected hundred (100) or more people 
iii.       Led to declaration of a state of emergency
iv.        Led to call for international assistance
