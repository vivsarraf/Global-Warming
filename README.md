# Overview

The metric showcases the Impact of Global Warming and rise of extreme weather events between 1990-2021 for the top 12 countries where mean temperature have increased significantly. Plotted bar chrts and Scatter plot to show the co relation between mean temperature rise and Increase of extreme weather events such as Wildfire, Storms, Floods etc.

# Instructions

Data Sets
Data sets were obtained from the following websites:

ii.         Affected hundred (100) or more people 

iii.       Led to declaration of a state of emergency

iv.        Led to call for international assistance
