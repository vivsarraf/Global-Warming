# Overview 
The metric showcases the following 4 topics:
 - The average surface temperature deviation from the 1951-1980 baseline across the 1990-2021 period for 12 countries
 - The analysis of CO2 emission amounts from 1995-2020 based on countries of the world and different working sectors
 - The Impact of Global Warming and the rise of extreme weather events between 1990-2021 for the top 12 countries where mean temperatures have increased significantly
 - The analysis of government spending on environmental protection
 ## Research Questions:
 - How has the average global temperature trend changed over the past decade?
 - What working sector is the worst for global warming based on CO2 and Greenhouse gasses emitted?
 - What are the impacts of global warming on weather patterns, extreme weather events, and wildfires?
 - How much do governments from all over the world spend to protect the environment from climate change?
   
 ## Data sets were obtained from the following websites:
  - The Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT), Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) / Université 
     Catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain), Brussels, Belgium 
  - EM-DAT: The Emergency Events Database - Université catholique de Louvain (UCL) - CRED, D. Guha-Sapir - www.emdat.be, 
     Brussels, Belgium. Only climate-related disasters (Wildfire, Storm, Landslide, Flood, Extreme Temperature, Drought, 
     Fog, Wave Action, and Glacial Lake Outburst) 
        
 ## Data sets Assumptions:
 EM-DAT covers disasters that
   - Killed ten (10) or more people 
   - Affected hundred (100) or more people 
   - Led to the declaration of a state of emergency
   - Led to call for international assistance 

## Files Included:
- Temperature Change.ipynb, Climate_Change_CO2.ipynb, WeatherPatterns.ipynb, EnvironmentProtectionExpendetures.ipynb : This Jupyter Notebook contains the Python code and analysis for the Global Warming project.
- It includes data loading, manipulation, calculations, and visualizations.
- Resources/Data.csv: CSV file containing temperature change-related data, including 12 countries such as Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, 
  Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

## How to Use:
Clone this repository to your local machine. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. Open the .ipynb files using Jupyter Notebook. Follow the instructions and run the code cells to execute the analysis. Review the output, including summary tables, visualizations, and insights derived from the analysis.
